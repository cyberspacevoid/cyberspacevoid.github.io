<p> <i> Project for the Future: An Anthology of new Sociotechnical Imaginaries </i> </p>
<article>
<p> is set to be a digital and print publication 
hightlighting individuals and 
collective groups 
who are working towards 
a just world, in areas of 
art, 
politics,
science
 and tech.  
<br>    It will feature illustrations (in the digital and print version)
and animations (in the digital version) to show concepts
and new possible worlds. 

We will illustrate and elaborate on such visual 
images as necessary. 

We are looking for queer and bipoc groups to feature. 

<i> Project for the Future </i>will serve as a playbook, manifesto, and 
creature blueprint for a hopeful world, and most importantly, as
a balance against the dismal news stories and projections that we've been 
hearing for far too long.
