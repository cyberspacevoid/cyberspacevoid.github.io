<pre>
<p><strong><i>Project for the Future: An Anthology of new Sociotechnical Imaginaries </i> </strong>
is set to be a digital and print publication 
hightlighting individuals and 
collective groups 
who are working towards 
a just world, in areas of 
art, 
politics,
science
and tech.  
<br>    It will feature designs (in the digital and print version)
and animations (in the digital version) to show concepts
and new possible worlds. 

<i>     Project for the Future </i>will serve as a playbook, manifesto, and 
creature blueprint for a hopeful world, and most importantly, as
a balance against the dismal news stories and projections that we've been 
hearing for far too long.

<p> If you would like to get involved with the project, or 
know of someone who would, please contact Clara Chen at <a href="mailto:clarachen@nscad.ca">clarachen@nscad.ca</a>
